# Case Study Company: Betterment

## Overview and Origin

### Betterment 


* When was the company incorporated?

The company was incorporated on August 2008 in Delaware but began operating out of New York city.


* Who are the founders of the company?

The company founders are Jon Stein and Eli Broverman. Technically, Jon’s roommate, Sean Owen, also helped found the company; however, he opted out before the company could launch in 2010. 

*How did the idea for the company come about?

The idea for the company began with Jon Stein. He wanted to create an investing platform that was simple to use, efficient, and centered on customer needs. At the time, Jon was working as a product developer and risk manager for a large firm in wall street. He learned that many of these big investment firms were very inefficient in the way they handled portfolios and did not focus on their customer’s needs. He concluded that the traditional way of wealth management was limited due to their lack of technology, which prevented them from yielding optimized investment results for their customers. Jon was determined to innovate the industry by creating the first robo-advisor company.

Jon’s roommate at the time, Sean Owen, was a brilliant software engineer who helped him set up the company’s machine learning programs, while Jon began to study up on the regulatory landscape.  From Stocks, to trusts, and estates, Jon began to immerse himself in the various risk structures of investment as well as the legal opportunities. This deep research lead him to reconnect with an old friend Eli Broverman, who at the time was a securities attorney. When Jon tells Eli the idea for the company, Eli becomes fascinated and joins as co-founder. Utilizing Jon’s unique formula for investing, along with his partner’s expertise in their fields of study, Betterment was established and thus the first robo-advisor company was created. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

For the first two years the three partners used their salaries and bootstrapped the company into operation. Until 2010 when they took home the award for Biggest New York Disruptor at the TechCrunch Disrupt held in New York City.  This event put them on the map for investors, and quickly attracted their first investor, Bessemer Venture Partners, who invested $3 million dollars at the time. Since, they’ve received $272 million in funding over 6 rounds from various other investors. Now as of 2019, the company has more than $16.4 Billion assets under management.

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

The company is focusing on wealth management solutions. They’re trying to make the industry overall more affordable and more efficient in operations and in portfolio assessment. Before machine learning technology many investors were leaving out important factors involved in assessing risk. For example, the Modern Portfolio Theory states that different investments can be strategically combined into different combinations of portfolio options and plotted against a projected return vs. Volatility graph to see which options yield the best returns. Machine learning algorithms can do this almost instantly while also considering other risk assessing ratios (that would normally be left out by traditional practices) and organize it into a visually informative manner for the customer to understand.  
Another major financial problem was that many firms in the industry required extremely high minimums and fees. This eliminated a large portion of the population that would not qualify for not meeting the outrages minimums; and if qualified to meet the minimum a 1 -1.5% fee was reduced from your portfolio. With Betterment there are no minimums and the fees have been significantly reduced to .25% on Investment returns.  

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

The company’s intended customers are for those who are beginner investors, hands-off investors, retirement investors, people with low balances, people who want automatic rebalancing, and or those who like the goal-based tools. Overall, they’re best suited for most types of investors in the industry. The wealth management industry is a behemoth industry world-wide. According to the Boston Consulting Group, this industry holds nearly $75 trillion in assets under management (AUM) with 60% of these assets belonging to large institutions as of 2019. That leaves the rest AUMs to the smaller firms. With the ease of access from robo-advisors, this number is changing drastically and smaller companies disrupting the market.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

The unfair advantage Betterment has over its competitors is the different account types it offers which revolve around the customer’s needs. Betterment outshines the rest by being able to offer a “flexible portfolio” tool. This tool helps you asses the level of risk an investor is willing to take for the potential return. For instance, customers who are willing to be exposed to a systematic risk can choose the “Smart Beta” option in order to yield higher than average returns. Others less adventurous may choose an income portfolio which is built solely of bonds and minimal risk. All in all, the customer has total control; and while other online investing companies offer similar of the competitive rates, with Betterment you get more bang for your buck. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Betterment is using various machine learning programs such as Python, Ruby, and PHP. Their HTTP server runs with Nginx. This is something they recently switched to since the company began using Apache as their HTTP server when they first launched in 2010. For web design they use programs HTML, CSS 3, Backbone, and Underscore. HTML and CSS are used via WordPress while Backbone and Underscore are dependent on JavaScript. 

Betterment also tracks their performance through a few web analytic programs such as Amazon CloudFront, Google Analytics, and Mandrill to name a few. Since they combine various software development and information technology operations, they use New Relic as their main development and operations (DevOps) platform.


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Betterment focuses on the robo-advising. It is the first company to introduce this domain to the public in the height of the great recession. Since pioneering the robo-advising industry in 2010, Betterment has been able to maintain number one according to Investopedia and NerdWallet.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

The major trend that robo-advisors have made in the last 10 years has been the number of customers and types of customers that it has attracted to passively invest in ETFs. Since the launch of the first robo-advisor, the industry has grown by $4 trillion in AUM. As far as innovation, robo-advising technology has redefined the way people invest and handle their finances. Before robo-advisors, people had to pay a personal finance agent to help them allocate their assets or manage their income. Now, these same customers can go online and do it themselves without having to leave their homes or having to speak to anyone. Above all, the results are more efficient since the machine learning algorithms process large data sets to give the customer optimal results. Moreover, the price of advising has reduced to where anyone can afford it. Personal advisors are very costly and the time you spend with them is limited. Lastly, some robo-advising companies also offer budgetary services. They can track customer transactions in real-time and identify their buying habits in order to help them save. 


* What are the other major companies in this domain?

Other major competitors in this domain include: 
*Wealthfront 
*Personal Capital 
*bloom
*Ellevest
*SoFi
*E*TRADE
*TD Ameritrade
Wealthfront is the next most advised robo-advisor company and is in close competition with Betterment. Both have their pros and cons. Where one fails the other succeeds; yet betterment has a larger AUM, a higher customer base, and no minimums.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Besides being the first robo-advisor company to launch, Betterment has increased the customer base for the industry. Before robo-advisors it was extremely difficult to get into investing securities. if you were a beginner or didn’t have thousands of dollars to invest, then companies wouldn’t be incentivized to work with you. Managing a portfolio required extensive time and effort; therefore, high minimums were required so that the time and effort was well compensated. One way that Betterment fixed this issue was with its machine learning algorithms, which made it so that huge data processing was computed in a matter of seconds; and therefore, eliminating minimums and decreasing fees to a decimal percentage.  
As pioneers of the information age, Betterment is also responsible for innovating the industry’s transparency. Having detailed information on their website about the different investment opportunities, Betterment educates their customers on the world of finance. For example, considering a retirement plan can be tricky and a 30-minute explanation at large institution is not enough to absorb all that information. So, by storing information in their website and organizing it in a visually appealing way, customers can learn at their own pace and make decisions whenever they feel ready. All in all, Betterment changed the way investing is done.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

The core metrics used to measure success in this domain are the number of assets under management (AUM) the company is currently handling. Based on Investopedia’s list of asset management companies, Betterment is hovering around $16.4 Billion AUM. It is at the top of other robo-advising companies. However, this metric may not be the best when comparing it against older firms with a broader range of investing options. Some of these old firms, like Vangard Personal Advisor Services established in 1971, have AUMs of $51 billion or more. Although Betterment offers better optimizing tools it is limited to investing only in exchange-traded funds (ETF) that represent about 12 asset classes. Other metrics of a company’s success measurement include customer satisfaction, which Betterment has one of the highest customer satisfaction rates.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

According to Andrea coombs’ 12 Best Robo-Advisors of March 2020 from NerdWallet, Betterment is the number one robo-advisor company to go with. Other companies like Wealthfront, Ellevest, and SoFi follow it right below. These other companies fall short because they either have higher fees, less customer satisfaction, or not enough tools for portfolio optimization.  Wealthfront is in close second; however, it falls in second because Betterment offers portfolio fractional shares, SRI portfolios, and no minimum. Whereas Wealthfront doesn’t offer fractional shares, SRI portfolios and has a minimum of $500.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers or use your imagination!)

If I had the opportunity to advise the company, I would start by telling them the benefits of real estate investments, Stock Options, futures, and Cryptocurrency. Real estate investments are normally very hard to liquify and long-term investments, but with PropTech it has made it easier to calculate future earnings from these types of investments. In terms of offering futures and stock options, these should be put into a higher risk portfolio that they can offer more aggressive investors. With machine learning technologies they can make more accurate predictions of the potential returns. Lastly cryptocurrency, these are highly volatile investments, but with the right machine learning algorithms they can yield very high returns. All the products mentioned above should be put into a high-risk portfolio where customers are warned of the risks involved. This way customers not only have the option to delve in these markets but also know the consequences.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Offering these products would benefit the company because it would help them stay competitive to the other companies while also increasing their revenue. Cryptocurrency for example is being offered by fast growing companies like Coinbase and RobinHood, so it is only logical that Betterment grew their own service line. Moreover, cryptocurrency has become a huge market where high returns can be achieved if invested correctly. With the machine learning technology, it has become easier to predict when to buy these volatile coins and when to sell. Betterment already has the technology; and if properly invested a customer can build a powerful portfolio with these coins alone. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

The technologies that would be used for these types of investments would be Proptech for the real-estate investments, fine-tuned machine learning algorithms for the futures and options, and a specialized set of algorithms for the cryptocurrencies. As I mentioned earlier, Betterment already has the technology for most these tools; it would just be a matter of fine tuning them to work for these types of investments. Going back to cryptocurrencies, they are known to be extremely volatile, but they still follow a pattern, nonetheless. For some coins the pattern is seasonal while others are more tethered to the behavior of the market. In all cases, a proper algorithm can decipher these patterns and better equip the customer to minimize risk as much as possible. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

These technologies are appropriate for my solution because fintech industry is growing. As new technology arrives, new companies will emerge. Just like Betterment changing the game of investment back in 2010, so can any other company in the near future. That is why for Betterment to stay on top it needs to keep up with technology as well as the products and services it offers. If they don’t then they will make the same mistake as the companies that got left behind for not keeping up with the new technological advancements.
